					<p>This project was a design experience tournament by Adobe Creative Jams in collaboration with Netflix using Adobe Xd. The challenge was to design a third-party desktop web site or desktop app (not Netflix-branded) where the community can celebrate shared stories together through communal and authentic experiences. In this challenge, I partnered with a good friend and colleague of mine, <a href="https://smistrydesign.ca/" target="_blank">Sidd Mistry.</a></p>

					<p>Our process focuses around the theme of community; creating an extension off the Netflix platform to connect and share experiences with others. Our solution to the brief is a “remote movie theatre” experience named Remotheatre, a website that allows Netflix users to remotely watch content in real-time with the goal of sharing their experiences with friends, family, and their community.

					<p>With Remotheatre, users can link their existing Netflix accounts and participate in scheduled remote screenings with friends and family, which includes a built-in chatroom and video call, to experience content together in real-time. Users are also able to view community screening events and chat with users from all around the world, participate in games and quizzes in a countdown lobby before community screenings, and learn more about their favourite content and creators in “Behind the Screens.”</p>
