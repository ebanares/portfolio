					<p>The task for this project is to create a book jacket with a unique identity made specifically for a chosen novel. The project will take an experimental approach as the main typography will be hand-lettered, constructed, or photographed. The final submission, seen above, is a physical mock-up of the jacket wrapped around an actual hardcover book.</p>

					<h3>The book I chose is <i>Animal Farm</i> by George Orwell.</h3>
					<p>To summarize, the book is about a group of farmyard animals who revolts against their human owners as they are tired of being fed so little for their labour. The animals drive the humans away and takes over the farm. It is renamed to Animal Farm, as the animals vow to forever eliminate inequity and injustice for all animal-kind. However, as time passes, the animals’ ideals are corrupted and forgotten.</p>

				<p class="three-desc">My goal for this book jacket is to use distressed industrial materials to highlight the corruption of power within <i>Animal Farm.</i> The cover is made out of corrugated cardboard with ripped pieces of paper and black acrylic paint for added depth and grime. 
				</p>
				<img class="four" src="../photos/animal/af_outsideB2.jpg">
				<p class="four-desc">In terms of typography, the title and headings are hand-painted using red acrylic paint mixed with black ink. The typography's design is based on the cardboard's corrugation, as it is difficult to paint in other styles that go against the grain of the corrugation.</p>
